# random password generator
The purpose of this assignment was to able to create a password which meets cetrtain criteria. 

As a new developer I have tried to create a website where a password will be generated which is 8-128 characters long and has an uppercase,lowercase letter,special characters and number. 

in order to do that firstly I created variables to store an array of uppercase, lowercase, number and special characters. Then  I used a for loop function to keep the choices going as the viwer selects it and keeps generating a new password within the criteria. Then I made a variable to store the generated password and added return function to return the generated password. 

I also used if/else statement to generate the password and determining different criteria. 

I think so far it matches the project criteria. However there are couple of things I faced challanges with. Creating a correct for loop was one of them which I took help from the internet to to able put together.

There are some incompleteness to this project. One of them is not being able to create a function that prevents the viewer from slecting a chracter length that is not within the criteria. I am hoping to fix this in future.

My biggest achievement from this project was to be able to put together all the elements and functions so that its somewhat working.
